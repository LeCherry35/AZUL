Azul (Portuguese for blue) is an abstract strategy board game. In Azul players collect sets of similarly colored tiles which they place on their player board. When a row is filled, one of the tiles is moved into a square pattern on the right side of the player board, where it garners points depending on where it is placed in relation to other tiles on the board. <br/> 
Since Azul is played openly, the game can be played on one screen, so here is digital version of it <br/>
